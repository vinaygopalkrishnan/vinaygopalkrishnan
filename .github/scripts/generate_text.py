Generate a single, short, inspirational, and creative quote or thought of the day related to coding, technology, or personal growth. Make it sound unique and not like a generic quote.

Example 1: The best code is written with a purpose, not just a plan.
Example 2: Every bug is an opportunity to learn the language you thought you knew.
Example 3: Your most powerful tool isn't your IDE, it's your curiosity.

Do not include any quotation marks in the output.
